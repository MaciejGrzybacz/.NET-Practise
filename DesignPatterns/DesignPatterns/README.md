# C# Design Patterns Implementation

This project aims to implement a variety of design patterns in C#. The purpose of this repository is to serve as a reference for learning and understanding how different design patterns can be applied in real-world C# applications.

## Introduction

This repository focuses on implementing design patterns in C#. Each design pattern is implemented in isolation with clear explanations and examples. The repository will be divided into three main categories:

- **Behavioral Patterns**
- **Creational Patterns**
- **Structural Patterns**

## Design Patterns

### Behavioral Patterns

Behavioral patterns are concerned with communication between objects. They define how objects interact with each other and distribute responsibilities.

- #### Mediator Pattern
   - The **Mediator Pattern** defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. Instead of allowing objects to refer to each other explicitly, they communicate through the mediator. This reduces dependencies between communicating objects, promoting loose coupling.
   You can find the implementation of the Mediator pattern in the `Behavioral/Mediator.cs` file.

### Creational Patterns

Creational patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

### Structural Patterns

Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping the structures flexible and efficient.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/design-patterns-csharp.git
    ```
2. Open the project in Visual Studio or your preferred C# IDE.
3. Navigate to the pattern you'd like to explore.
4. Run the pattern-specific project.
