# LINQ Exercises: Bookstore Project

## Overview

This project is part of a series of exercises designed to practice and demonstrate the use of LINQ (Language Integrated Query) with Entity Framework Core in a C# environment. The project simulates a bookstore database, allowing for various queries and data manipulations.

## Project Goals

- Demonstrate proficiency in LINQ syntax and usage
- Practice working with Entity Framework Core for database operations
- Implement complex queries to retrieve and manipulate data
- Showcase C# programming skills in a practical, database-driven application

## Project Structure

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the application, demonstrating the use of various bookstore queries.
- `Bookstore.cs`: Contains the data models, database context, and detailed documentation of the implemented queries.

## Current Features

- Database seeding with sample data
- Various LINQ queries to retrieve information about books and authors
- Demonstration of different LINQ methods and techniques


## Dependencies

- Entity Framework Core
- SQLite database provider (for local development and testing)

For a detailed description of the implemented LINQ queries and their functionalities, please refer to the comments in the `Bookstore.cs` file.
