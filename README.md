# .NET Practice Project

This repository is a practice project for learning and experimenting with .NET, specifically focusing on LINQ and Entity Framework Core. The project includes various examples and exercises to demonstrate how to use LINQ queries in a real-world scenario.

## Project Structure

- **Bookstore.cs**: This file contains LINQ queries that operate on an Entity Framework Core setup, simulating a bookstore database. The queries are written in method syntax and cover common database operations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.
  
## Key Concepts Covered

- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Query data from collections and databases using a concise, readable syntax. The project emphasizes using functional (method) syntax.
- **Entity Framework Core**: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for .NET, enabling developers to work with databases using .NET objects.
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on entities using LINQ and EF Core.

## Future Improvement
This repository will be updated with new mini projects, weitten in C#
