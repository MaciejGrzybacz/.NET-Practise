# .NET Practice Project

This repository is a practice project for learning and experimenting with .NET, specifically focusing on LINQ and Entity Framework Core. The project includes various examples and exercises to demonstrate how to use LINQ queries in a real-world scenario.

## Project Structure

- **LINQ_exercises**: This solution contains LINQ queries that operate on an Entity Framework Core setup, simulating a bookstore database. The queries are written in method syntax and cover common database operations such as filtering, sorting, and aggregating data.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **LINQ (Language Integrated Query)**: Query data from collections and databases using a concise, readable syntax. The project emphasizes using functional (method) syntax.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Object-relational mapping (ORM) framework for .NET, used to work with databases using .NET objects.
- **C# Programming**: Demonstrating C# language features and best practices in the context of database operations and LINQ queries.

## Current Features

- Database context setup for a bookstore scenario
- Various LINQ queries demonstrating different operations:
  - Filtering data
  - Sorting and ordering
  - Joining related data
  - Aggregating data
  - Projecting data into new forms

## Future Improvements

This repository will be continuously updated with:

- New solutions written in C#
- More complex LINQ queries and scenarios
- Advanced Entity Framework Core features
- Possible integration with other .NET technologies
- Performance optimization techniques for LINQ and EF Core

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have the latest .NET SDK installed on your machine.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the LINQ_exercises directory.
4. Run `dotnet restore` to restore the necessary packages.
5. Explore the different queries in the `BookstoreQueries` class.
6. Run the project using `dotnet run` to see the queries in action.

## Contributing

As this is a learning project, contributions, suggestions, and discussions are welcome. Feel free to open issues or pull requests if you have ideas for new queries or improvements to existing ones.
